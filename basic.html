          It's 2003, several months since the US officially declared war on
          Iraq,<br />
          and the American political world has evolved. Tensions are high<br />,
          hate crimes<br />
          are on the rise, FBI agents are infiltrating local mosques, and the
          Muslim community <br />is harassed and targeted more than ever. Shadi,
          who wears hijab, keeps her head down. <br />

          She's too busy drowning in her own troubles to find the time to deal
          with bigots.<br />

          Shadi is named for joy, but she's haunted by sorrow. Her brother is
          dead, her father is dying, her mother <br />
          is falling apart, and her best friend has mysteriously dropped out of
          her life. And then, of course, there's the small matter of her
          heart--<br />

          It's broken.

          <br />Shadi tries to navigate her crumbling world by soldiering
          through, saying nothing. She devours <br />her own pain, each day
          retreating farther and farther inside herself until finally, one day,
          everything changes.<br />

          She explodes.
