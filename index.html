          It's 2003, several months since the US officially
          <span style="font-size: larger"> war</span> on Iraq,<br />
          and the American political world has evolved. Tensions are high,
          <span style="color: rgb(193, 22, 22)">HATE</span>
          <br />
          crimes are on the rise, FBI agents are

          >,
          <br />
          and the Muslim community is harassed and targeted more than ever.
          <br />Shadi, who wears hijab, her head down<br />

          She's too busy drowning in her own troubles to find the time to deal
          with bigots.<br />
          Shadi is named for joy, but she's haunted by sorrow. Her brother is
          dead, <br />
          her father is <span style="color: rgb(90, 88, 88)">dying</span>, her

          mysteriously dropped out of her life. And then, of course, there's the
          small matter of her heart--<br />

          <span>It's broken</span>. Shadi tries to navigate her crumbling world
          by soldiering through, saying nothing.<br />
          She devours her own <span>pain</span>, each day retreating farther and
          farther inside herself <br />
          until finally, one day, everything changes.
          <span style="text-decoration: underline">She explodes</span>.

        <p>
          An Emotion of Great Delight is a searing look into the world of a
          single Muslim family in the wake of 9/11. It's about a child of
          immigrants forging a blurry identity, falling in love, and finding
          hope--in the midst of a modern war.
